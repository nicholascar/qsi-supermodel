// == Introduction

// A Supermodel is an integrated, multi-part data model following a pattern implemented specifically for a particlar scenario. This Supermodel is implemented for the Queensland Land Information Implementation Testing project, started in April, 2022.

// === _Viewpoints_

// This Supermodel is described in series of resources that are formulated according to the Reference Model for Open Distributed Processing (RM-ODP) <<RMODP>>. Each resource presents a _viewpoint_ which gives a different perspective on the scenario.

// The main resources within this Supermodel and the RM-ODP _viewpoint_ for which they are defined are:

// . https://nicholascar.com/qsi-supermodel/supermodel.html[Model Document] - the _Information Viewpoint_
// . https://nicholascar.com/qsi-supermodel/requirements.html[Requirements listing] - part of the _Enterprise Viewpoint_
